# Thesaurus concepts browser

We're working on developing a GLOBALISE thesaurus with definitions of concepts that occur in the _Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren_ series of VOC documents. A preliminary version of the thesaurus can be explored in our [SKOSMOS environment](https://vocabulary.globalise.dev.diginfra.net/).[^1]

Please note that the thesaurus is constantly being improved and extended, and the the URIs in the current version are not stable.

[^1]: This demo is running the [SKOSMOS software](https://skosmos.org/), developed by the National Library of Finland, to provide a user-friendly interface to our thesaurus. The SKOSMOS software is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Skosmos).
