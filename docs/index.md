The aim of the [GLOBALISE project](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/) is to develop an online infrastructure that unlocks the key series of VOC documents and reports for advanced new research methods. On this Lab page, we share our ongoing and completed experiments and prototypes. We welcome your feedback through the contact form on [https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/contact-us/](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/contact-us/).

GLOBALISE is funded by the [The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)](https://www.nwo.nl/en).
