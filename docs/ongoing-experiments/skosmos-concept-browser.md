# SKOSMOS

We're working on developing a GLOBALISE thesaurus with definitions of concepts that occur in the 'Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren' series of VOC documents. A preliminary version of the thesaurus can be explored in our SKOSMOS environment. Please note that the thesaurus is constantly being improved and extended, and the the URIs in the current version are not stable.
